I recently came across this beautiful YouTube playlist, where I had the opportunity to learn a little
more about differential equations, so I decided to write this program with the hope of consolidating
that knowledge and to learn some numerical methods for solving PDEs.

### Install and run
The program requires `SDL2` and `make` to be installed in your system in order to run.   

1. Clone this repository
2. Compile with `make`
3. Run with `./bin/main`
